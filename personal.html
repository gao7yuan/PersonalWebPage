    Yuan was born in Nantong, Jiangsu, a small but nice city in east coast of China.
    She spent her undergraduate years in Fudan University in Shanghai, where she got her
    Bachelor's degree in chemistry. After that, she pursued a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry
    in Michigan State University under the direction of <a href="https://hamanngroup.weebly.com">Prof. Thomas Hamann</a>.
    During her research she realized that many sciensts spend too much time on repeated work,
    which is a waste of time and resource. She decided to explore the area of computer Science
    to realize automation of many processes in scientific research as well as in people's daily life.
    Now she is studying computer science at Northeastern University in Seattle.

    Yuan enjoys a lot of activities outside the classroom. She likes sports, especially
    badminton, archery and skiing. She also plays video games like
    <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net">CSGO</a>,
    <a href="https://playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu">PUBG</a> (PUBG is better than Fortnite yay!),
    and a tiny bit of <a href="http://www.dota2.com/play/">DOTA2</a> (which she is terrible at).
