    A stack deposition-annealing (SDA) approach was demonstrated for the synthesis of
CuWO4 via atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulted CuWO4 showed promising activity
as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. This methodology can, in
principal, be utilized for the ALD of many ternary and quaternary oxides for various
applications.

    The hole collection efficiency of water oxidation was evaluated for CuWO4 electrodes from
comparisons of the photocurrent of H2O2 and Na2SO3 oxidation as well as intensity
modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements. We found current
multiplication using H2O2, however use of Na2SO3 and IMPS revealed quantitative water
oxidation at 1.23 V vs. RHE.

    Electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and impedance spectroscopy measurements were
performed to investigate the role of CuWO4 surface states during water oxidation. We found
that a capacitive feature related to a surface state is clearly observable under water
oxidation conditions. The magnitude of the surface state capacitance is light intensity-
dependent, with a peak potential that coincides with the water oxidation onset potential
region. The surface state is not observed in the dark nor in contact with nonaqueous
solvents. These results strongly support our assignment of this surface state as the buildup
of water oxidation intermediate species at the surface of CuWO4 photoanodes, not a
permanent or intrinsic state as previously reported. We suggest this is a general feature that
controls the behavior and efficiency of solar water splitting reactions.
